        question: "Do I have to be Romanian or Orthodox to attend?",
        answer: "Not at all! Non-Romanians and non-Orthodox-Christians are always welcome to come to our church. We have many people from different backgrounds - people born into the Faith, converts, Romanians, non-Romanians - and this church is a second home for all of them. This is not a Romanian or Orthodox club, but a place for the salvation of souls."

    {
        question: "What should I expect when I arrive?",
        answer: "Upon entering, you will see the laity standing facing the altar where the priest serves. At any given moment, you will hear prayers read or sung, see people lighting candles, and people venerating icons. If you are new to Orthodoxy, it is best to observe what is happening and ask any questions you may have to the priest or someone knowledgeable after the service."

    {
        question: "How should I dress to church?",
        answer: "It is important to dress respectfully and modestly in church; we come to church not to be seen by others, but by God. Generally, men wear anything ranging from nice pants with a dress shirt to a full suit, while women wear long dresses or skirts and optionally a head covering. Please refrain from wearing shorts or anything exposing as well as graphic shirts with inappropriate images or language. It is best to keep it simple and elegant."
    },
    {
        question: "How long is the service?",
        answer: "Our Orthros service (prayers before the Divine Liturgy) is about an hour long, with the Divine Liturgy being about an hour and a half to two hours long. Please review the calendar for more details on the times of our services."
    },
    {
        question: "Why are people lighting candles?",
        answer: "It is a tradition to purchase candles and light them as an offering to God along with your prayers, usually when entering the church. Be mindful of when you light candles as to not do so during the Epistle, Gospel, or sermon."
    },
    {
        question: "Why are people kissing icons?",
        answer: "We kiss icons as veneration of type via a prototype. A good analogy would be telling your mother you love her over the phone: you are not telling a phone that you love it, but your mother via the phone; in this case, the type would be the mother, and the prototype would be the phone. Also, be mindful of where you kiss an icon. It is not proper to kiss the face, but the hand, foot, cross, and so on, of the person depicted."
    },
    {
        question: "Why are we praying to saints?",
        answer: "Praying to saints is an ancient Christian tradition practiced since Christ's time on this Earth. Saints are those who reposed from this life in Communion with God, thus, they are not dead, but alive in Heaven through Christ's sacrifice (John 3:16). By praying to the saints, we are praying to the living, asking them to intercede with God on our behalf because \"The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much\" (James 5:16). Think of it as analogous to asking a friend or family member to pray for you."

    {
        question: "Is there anything after church?",
        answer: "You are welcome to join us for the Agape meal after church where we socialize and enjoy a meal together. This is also a great time to ask questions and get to know others."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I receive Communion?",
        answer: "Holy Communion is reserved only for those received by the Orthodox Faith and in good standing with the Church through prayer, fasting, alms-giving, and Confession. If you do not fit those criteria, you may still receive the blessed bread at the end of the service as that is not Holy Communion. Furthermore, if someone approaches with the blessed bread, you may take it as a sign of hospitality."
