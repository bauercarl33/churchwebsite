            'Our journey began on September 8, 2002, when Fr. Iulian Anitei led the first Divine Liturgy here in Austin. In our early days, Fr. Iulian, together with founding members Dan Stiurca, Cristian Tiu, Aurelian Dumitru, and Octavian Herescu, established our first Parish Council. Over the years, our community has been blessed with the guidance of five dedicated priests: Fr. Iulian Anitei, Fr. Vichentie Punguta, Fr. Florin Craioveanu, Fr. Dumitru Ilies, and, currently, Fr. Gabriel-Teofil Ilies.',

This property was acquired with the vision of building a new church to support the spiritual growth of our community.',
            'Today, Saint Mary Orthodox Church is home to about 40 families. Our mission is to offer spiritual “medication” to all who seek it. Services are held in both English and Romanian, with Sunday School conducted in English. After each Divine Liturgy, it is our cherished tradition to gather as a family for a communal lunch. Our goal remains to create a lasting church for future generations to cherish and grow within.'
